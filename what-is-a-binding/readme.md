# About bindings
# 1- You must bind modules in your app
## How:
- You put required modules in require property of your app, in mta.yaml file.
- See example mta.yaml file in this project. You will see resources and modules.
# Am`I obligated to create modules to make thse bindings?
- No. You only make bindings of things you really need, like app-db, app-destination (if you use destinations in your app)
